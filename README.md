## Description
Make and move Pacmen across the screen. The Add PacMan button will add a PacMan at a random position on the screen. The Move PacMan button will move the PacMan forward at a random speed and velocity. By continuing to click the buttons, you can add as many PacMen as you like and move them faster across the screen.

## Future Mods
Add the signature ghost that "kills" the PacMan upon contact/when they intersect.
